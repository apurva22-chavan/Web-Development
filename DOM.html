<!-- JavaScript was initially created to make web pages alive. JS can be written right in a web page's HTML to make it interative.
 The browser has an embedded engine called the JavaScript engine or thr=e JavaScript runtime.
 JavaScipt's ability in the browser is very limited to protect the user's safety/ For Example a webpage ot https://google.com cannot access https://codeswear.com and steal information from there. 
 
 Developer's tools:
 Every browser has some developer tools  which makes a devleoper's life a lot easier.
